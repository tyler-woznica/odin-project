    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, 
        fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably 
        already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
        <li>Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
        <li>Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the dry ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.</li>
        <li>Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking until brown on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
